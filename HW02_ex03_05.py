# This exercise can be done using only the statements and other features we 
# have learned so far.

# (1) Write a function that draws a grid like the following:
# + - - - - + - - - - +
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# + - - - - + - - - - +
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# + - - - - + - - - - +
# Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print a comma-separated
# sequence:

# print '+', '-'
# If the sequence ends with a comma, Python leaves the line unfinished, so the 
# value printed next appears on the same line.

# print '+', 
# print '-'

# The output of these statements is '+ -'.

# A print statement all by itself ends the current line and goes to the next line.

# (2) Write a function that draws a similar grid with four rows and four columns.
